# Rolling Doubles

## Rolling Doubles @unplugged
Write a program that determines if the user rolled doubles in dice. Create two variables and set them equal to ``||math:randint||`` values to represent dice rolls. 
Print out the results on a new line after they enter it.
You should prints the results of whether there were doubles in an ``||logic:if else||`` and with  ``||adventure:add text to textlog||``.
